🌟 About Me
I’m a Data Science and Cybersecurity enthusiast passionate about leveraging technology for data-driven decision-making and secure systems. My journey started in the chemical industry, where I developed strong analytical skills. Today, I apply these skills to Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and Automation, while exploring Cybersecurity fundamentals.
My professional experience in unions and politics has shaped my strategic thinking and problem-solving approach. I’m currently transitioning into IT through a career change program (LTA), aiming for roles like Fachinformatiker für Anwendungsentwicklung or Threat Intelligence Analyst.
